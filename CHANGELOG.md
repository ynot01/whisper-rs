# Version 0.7.0 (2023-05-10)
* Update upstream whisper.cpp to v1.4.0 (integer quantization support, see last point for CUDA support)
* Expose `WhisperState` as a public type, allowing for more control over the state.
  * `WhisperContext::create_state` now returns a `WhisperState` instead of `()`.
  * All methods that took a key argument in v0.6.0 have been moved to `WhisperState`.
* Generic key argument on `WhisperContext` has been removed.
* Note: CUDA and OpenCL acceleration is supported on the `cuda-and-opencl-support` branch of the git repo,
  and will probably be released in v0.8.0.

# Version 0.6.0 (2023-04-17)
* Update upstream whisper.cpp to v1.3.0
* Fix breaking changes in update, which cascade to users:
  * `WhisperContext`s now have a generic type parameter, which is a hashable key for a state map.
    This allows for a single context to be reused for multiple different states, saving memory.
    * You must create a new state upon creation, even if you are using the context only once, by calling `WhisperContext::create_key`.
    * Each method that now takes a state now takes a key, which internally is used to look up the state.
    * This also turns `WhisperContext` into an entirely immutable object, meaning it can be shared across threads and used concurrently, safely.

  * `DecodeStrategy` has been renamed to `SamplingStrategy`
  * `WhisperContext::sample_best`'s signature has changed: `needs_timestamp` has been removed.
* New features
  * `WhisperContext::full_n_tokens`
  * `WhisperContext::full_get_token_text`
  * `WhisperContext::full_get_token_id`
  * `WhisperContext::full_get_token_prob`
